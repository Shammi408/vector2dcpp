# vector2dcpp
vector<vector<int>> arr

We will be taking inputs of how many vectors there are(inside a vector) and how many queries we will do.
Then we take input of all the vectors as a string(one by one)
Convert them in integers and input them in a temporaray vector.
We will then push this vector to our main vector arr.

We will take queries in a array [i,j] form where i is index of arr vector and j is index of vector at arr[i].
Then we print the desired outputs.
